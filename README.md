# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python 🚀


Welcome to **Data Structures and Algorithms in Python**! 🎉 This project is designed as a dynamic, hands-on resource for learning and practicing data structures and algorithms in the Pytohn programming language.

* More than one hundred rehearsal problems different pattern problems.
* Executable and comes with 100% test coverage, ensuring correctness and quality
* Completely free, community-editable, and continuously evolving
* Ability to study and practice in your favorite IDE, editor, or web browser

## 📋 Outline

Each topic includes the following sections:

* 💡 **Implementation**: Overview of implementing the data structure or algorithm.
* 📊 **Complexity**: Analysis of the time and space complexity of the data structure or algorithm.
* 🎯 **Application**: Discuss problems commonly solved using the data structure or algorithm.
* 📝 **Rehearsal**: Practice problems with links to tests that provide 100% coverage and example inputs and outputs.
